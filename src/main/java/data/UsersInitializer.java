/**
 * This class is responsible for retrieving all members from the Discord server
 * that are stored in the database and saving them in a {@link java.util.Map}.
 * <p>
 * The Map serves as a structured storage of all server members, where various
 * methods and operations can be applied afterwards.
 * <p>
 * Each entry in the Map typically represents a member, indexed by a unique
 * identifier (e.g. user ID), allowing for efficient lookups and data handling.
